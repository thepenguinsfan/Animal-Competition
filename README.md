### Animal Competition
**Game Description**
>This game will take 2 animals of the user's choice and put them together in a friendly competition. The animals will have to go through a set of challenges to determine a winner.

**Examples**
> Animals are put into a desert and have to find water in order to survive, the survivor or whoever finds the water first wins. Certain animals can have certain traits that will give them an advantage over the competition. These traits could be being able to detect moisture with their senses, or knowing the lay of the land to find water. From the players' perspective, the game will display the progress of each animal and how close they are to finding water, and maybe hint at how they found it.

> Animals are put into a forest and will have to hunt for food. Certain animal traits will determine how an animal can hunt, and the winner.

> Animals are put into an environment during a certain time(day/night) and the time will either strengthen or weaken certain traits of animals.
